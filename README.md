# PredBit - Machine Learning Project

Machine Learning project to predict the maintenance of healthy habits.

## Project Overview
PredBit explores how behavioral and lifestyle patterns influence the ability 
to sustain healthy habits over time.

The current implementation focuses on predicting **anxiety levels** using 
behavioral data, while future models will expand into other areas of well-being.

## Current Model: Anxiety Levels
This first model uses the following features:
- Daily screen time
- Notification frequency
- Social media usage

It classifies whether an individual has high or low anxiety levels.

## Roadmap: Four Core Models
The complete system will integrate four predictive components:

1. Anxiety levels (implemented)
2. Sleep quality (planned)
3. Nutrition (planned)
4. Focus degree (planned)

Together, these models will provide a holistic predictor for long-term 
habit maintenance.

## Project Goal
The main objective is to determine whether an individual can sustain 
a **flow state** and develop a **resilient mindset**, which serve as 
proxies for successful and lasting habit formation.
